## Notes

### Rolling resistance force
The rolling resistance force occurs due to the friction between the tires and the driving surface. The rolling resistance force is zero at standstill. 
When the vehicle starts moving, the rolling resistance force acts in the direction opposite to the direction of motion and can be calculated by the 
rolling resistance coefficient Cr multiplied by the normal force between the vehicle and the road. For a flat surface, the normal force is the vehicle 
mass m times the standard gravity g.

In the case of a road with an inclination angle, the normal force becomes the weight m.g multiplied by the cosine of the road angle. It is important 
to note that the rolling resistance force is independent of the vehicle speed, and it is always opposite the driving direction. The coefficient Cr 
should be low so as to keep the frictional losses low. For modern cars, it’s typically around 0.01 to 0.02.

### Aerodynamic drag force
As the vehicle speed increase, the aerodynamic drag force opposes the vehicle motion as the air as is forced to flow around the moving vehicle. It 
can be calculated as the product of the aerodynamic drag coefficient Cd the front area of the vehicle Af, the air density and the square of the vehicle 
speed v, divided by 2.

It is hence important to note that the aerodynamic drag in independent of vehicle mass but has a strong dependence on the vehicle speed. That is why in 
a car, the aerodynamic drag force is higher than the rolling resistance force when the speed is above about 70 to 80 km/h. Secondly, the coefficient of 
drag is typically about 0.25 to 0.35 for a modern car. SUVs, with their typically boxy shapes, have coefficients in the range of 0.35 to 0.45.

### Gradient force
The third force that acts on a vehicle is the gradient force, and it occurs when the vehicle is driving on an uphill or a downhill road. The gradient 
force is due to the longitudinal component of gravitational force, namely mgsin(theta) where theta is the inclination angle of the road. As seen earlier, 
the cosine component of the gravity contributes to the normal force and the corresponding rolling resistance force. The gradient force and the angle theta 
are negative when driving downhill, and positive when driving uphill. Road gradients are expressed as a percentage in terms of tangent theta and have a 
value typically between plus or minus 10%. 

If we now consider a vehicle moving on an inclined surface, then the aerodynamic drag force, the rolling resistance force and the gradient force act on 
the vehicle. If we now include the traction force provided by the vehicle powertrain, then the net force on the vehicle, is the difference between the 
traction force and the sum of the forces due to the aerodynamic drag, the rolling resistance, and the road gradient.

By Newton’s second law, the net force is equal to the product of the vehicle mass and vehicle acceleration. Therefore, we can control the vehicle 
acceleration and thereby the speed by controlling the traction force that the powertrain produces. The traction force is in the driving direction 
most of the time, but it can be zero when the vehicle is coasting or even negative when the powertrain is under regenerative braking.

If we now expand the equation for the traction force, we can see the factors that influence the vehicle forces: the vehicle mass and road angle affects 
the rolling resistance and gradient force, vehicle speed decides the aerodynamic drag force, and the rest of the traction force decides the vehicle 
acceleration. If we need to estimate the power delivered by the powertrain, then we need to multiply the traction force with the speed of the vehicle.
