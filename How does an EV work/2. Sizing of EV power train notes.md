## Notes

### Rolling resistance force
The rolling resistance force occurs due to the friction between the tires and the driving surface. The rolling resistance force is zero at standstill. 
When the vehicle starts moving, the rolling resistance force acts in the direction opposite to the direction of motion and can be calculated by the 
rolling resistance coefficient Cr multiplied by the normal force between the vehicle and the road. For a flat surface, the normal force is the vehicle 
mass m times the standard gravity g.
